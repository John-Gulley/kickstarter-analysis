# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
The included Excel file contains the information showing the collected data on plays across the world. The information was used to help determine when would be the best time to launch a new play, and about how much to expect in spending to see a successfully met goal for said play.

	In sorting through the data, I was able to find that the most successful play goals were between the range of $1000 - $ 5000. While the least successful plays were $1000 or less. In addition, the most successful launching month was in May, with June right behind. Counter to that, July was the worst month to try and launch a funding for a play. With October coming in a very close second.

	Some of the limitations I ran into (And indeed what made this truly challenging for me) for that one of the data sheets asked to be made wanted to know how many plays were canceled during their pledging stage. This is information I simply donâ€™t have access to, so am unclear as to how to find the answer.

	I think that with all the information being asked for, a pie graph would have been a good inclusion, as percentages were asked for with the second part of this three-part test. Pie graphs are great for showing percentages and this would have made the information readable immediately. That said, I sadly did not have all the data to take this extra step. 

The purpose of these charts is to show when is best and when is worst for launching a fundraiser campaign for a play. I believe I have done just that with the date I have been able to supply, and that with the information provided; one could start (and complete) a successful fundraiser.

	Two conclusions that could be drawn from this data would be that mid-year is the best time to launch a fundraiser for a play, and that asking for way more than you need is going to cause you to fail. There is a sweet spot if you will. Too little and people might think your play is not worth it, but too much and enough people might not come to aid you.
